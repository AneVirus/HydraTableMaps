Info:
- Table maps are designed for default ignition table size of 809x645
- Do not minimize tables, because after you switchback size will change - bot won't connect.

Other:
OH version 11.1.3 has bug with ttlimits, only one "ttlimits" is used other ttlimitsX are ignored. 
This issue is fixed in OH build v11.2.0 and above. Please ensure bot reading blinds levels correctly for safe play.


NOTEEE Make sure you set compatiability mode (in properties) to Windows Vista!!! or this wont connect due to API access issues implemented by Ignition!
